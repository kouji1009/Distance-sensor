This project is created based on the sofeware called MPLAB.
MPLAB can be controlling digital input and output (DIO), analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), pulse width modulation (PWM), and timing.
Using these features, I created the sensor that make a sound and change the frequency of sound depending on the distance between object and sensor.
